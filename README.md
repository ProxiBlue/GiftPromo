The ProxiBlue Gift Promotions Extension is now open source
==========================================================

Unfortunately due to personal time issues, contractual work related time
issues and a whole heap of other factors, I no longer have the time to
continue support for this extension, as of Jan 2017

I have thus decided to opensource tjis work, for the community to use,
extend, and freely use.

*THIS DOES NOT ALLOW YOU THE RIGHT TO TAKE / SELL / MAKE YOUR OWN*

The code remains copyrighted material. YOU MAY NOT SELL IT.
You can use the extension freely in as many sites as youlike, but the code
must remain FREE

I will take action to any that tries to make this their 'own work' and sell
as their own extension to the community.

Feel free to add / feed back changes for others.

I can answer questions, but I cannot support bugs.
