The ProxiBlue Gift Promotions Extension is now FREE
==========================================================

Unfortunately due to personal time issues, contractual work related time
issues and a whole heap of other factors, I no longer have the time to
continue support for this extension, as of Jan 2017

I have thus decided to make this work FREE, for the community to use,
extend, and freely use.

*THIS DOES NOT ALLOW YOU THE RIGHT TO TAKE / SELL AS YOUR OWN*

All copytight notices must remain intact, and continue to be distributed with the software.
You can sell this software as part of a Magento Build, but not as an individual module (you cannot make direct sales from this source code alone, period - it is FREE)
